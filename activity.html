        Our time on this planet is limited. Most of us realize that sooner or later. And yet, we keep on squandering our time and running around in circles.
        <br>
        Why is it that we waste so much of our time? Most people think that we, humans, don’t understand the value of time.
        <br>
        I don’t think that’s the problem. You and I both know the value of time. It’s a depletable resource. By that definition, the value of time is high.
        <br>
        So if the problem is not our appreciation of time, what’s the cause of a waste of time and potential?
        <br>
        The answer is obvious: We simply don’t know what to do with our time. The stoic philosopher Seneca famously said in On The Shortness Of Life:
        <br>
        “It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it.”
        <br>
        Most of us read that and get a temporary boost: “Wow, I need to value my time and stop wasting it.” 
        <br>
        As an exercise, I recommend everyone to sit down and think about what activities are worth your time. This is a personal exercise. Everybody values different things. To give you an idea of how I spend my time, I’ve made a list of 15 activities that I consider worthwhile.
        <br><br>
       <b>Working out </b> — I especially like strength training because being strong is one of the most useful things in life. Sitting behind your desk for hours, going shopping, traveling — your life will be a lot easier when you’re physically strong.

       <br><br>
      <b> Spending time with people you love</b> — It doesn’t really matter what you do. It’s more about being around people you genuinely care about. That will lift your spirits and give you energy

      <br><br>
     <b></b> Learning how your body works</b> — Everybody should know how their body functions. I also like to read about the latest scientific research on health and fitness.
     <br><br>
     <b>Journaling</b> — It’s always nice to sit down at the end of a day and reflect. What did I do today? What did I learn? What am I going to do tomorrow? Answering those questions is the best time you’ll spend every day.
     <br><br>
     <b>Learning a skill</b></Learning> — Always be learning a new skill. I started practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu a while back. I go to class every week and I constantly learn from YouTube videos. I always want to learn a new skill because it reminds me that I’m always a student.
     <br><br>
     <b>Making a financial strategy</b> — I like to read and hear about investing strategies of different people. Even though I consider myself a value investor, I still look at what day traders do. I’m interested in finance because I don’t want to waste my hard-earned money.
     <br><br>
    <b> Watching good movies/tv-shows </b>— I sometimes make fun of people who binge-watch tv shows. I think that’s a waste of your day. But I love movies and good shows. They can give you inspiration too.
